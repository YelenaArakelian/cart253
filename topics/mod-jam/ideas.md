## Frog Feaster 3000 - Mod Jam Ideas

# Concept

The game started as a simple idea, a frog catching flies with its tongue while his peers watch him.  
I wanted to expand it into something more dynamic and expressive with sound, motion, and humor while keeping the gameplay clear and interactive.

# Gameplay

- Move the frog using then mouse.
- Click left mouse click to shoot the tongue and catch flies.
- Avoid the horseflies, which causes strikes when eaten.
- The game ends after 3 strikes.

# Features

- Frog grows as it eats.
- Every 5 hits: horsefly rages and shakes more.
- Confetti GIF + croak sound celebrate milestones.
- Background “DistractionFlashbang” video adds humor and distraction.
- Frog friends’ eyes follow the main frog for curiosity.

# Design

I focused on clear reactions through visuals and sound:

- "mlem" = eat, "hurt" = damage, "croak" = milestone.
  Top corners display strikes and flies eaten for clarity.

# Yvonne Arriola Lerin: [Am I a Frog?] (https://scarlett253.github.io/CART253/Topics/mod-jam/)

I found this project visually pleasing because of the background aesthetic, a transition to blue to darker blue with the animated stars makes the game feel nostalgic in some sense while still keeping the focus on the flies. I also find it more chaotic yet intriguing having the flies come out in the middle of the screen rather than coming from the sides, it makes the game in some way more deranged. Another visual detail I found interesting is how the score counter drops into negatives when I hit the red flies and only recovers after catching a normal fly, this way, it makes it simple but a useful indicator of the user's performance. Although, I would've anticipated seeing an extra visual effect to make the penalty feel clearer and more impactful. Also, I find the "YOU ARE NOT A FROG!" and "YOU ARE A FROG!" screens to be interesting because of the animations, it is aesthetically pleasing and adapts well to its theme.

# Amélie Barrette: [Hungry Froggy] (https://nounoune666.github.io/cart253/topics/Mod_Jam/)

This project stood out to me because of its mechanic concept of moving through the air to eat flies while avoiding the harmful ones. This project encourages focus and fast reflexes, which I enjoy the most in games like these. The sound effects used evoke a sense of nostalgia and resemble the sound effects used in old Nintendo games. Since it uses a different mechanic than the other projects, I appreciate the instruction tab to let the user know how the game works, as it is quite useful for understanding the gameplay. The random patterns of flies that appear also make the game more immersive since you have to strategize and use your reflexes to dodge the bad flies.

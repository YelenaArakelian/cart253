# Yvonne Arriola Lerin: [Am I a Frog?] (https://scarlett253.github.io/CART253/Topics/mod-jam/)

I found this project visually pleasing because of the background aesthetic, a transition to blue to darker blue with the animated stars makes the game feel nostalagic in some sense while still keeping the focus on the flies. I also find it more chaotic yet intruiging having the flies come out in the middle of the screen rather coming from the sides, it makes the game in some way more deranged. Another visual detail I found interesting is how the score counter drops into negatives when I hit the red flies and only recovers after catching a normal fly, this way, it makes it simple but a useful indicator of the user's performance. Although, I would've anticipated seeing an extra visual effect to make the penalty feel clearer and more impacftul. Also, I find the "YOU ARE NOT A FROG!" and "YOU ARE A FROG!" screen to be interesting because of the animations, it is aesthetically pleasing and adapts well to its theme.

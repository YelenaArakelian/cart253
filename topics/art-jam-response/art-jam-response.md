I found this project interesting for its energetic visualization yet minimalistic design. The soft color palette chosen gives the project an endearing yet childlike touch that draws the users in. While skimming through the project, I realized the cursor also engages with the bee's mouth by growing its mouth, just like the character itself, which is amusing. Likewise, the use of simple geometric shapes and bold colors creates a playful atmosphere. The use of holding left click, turning my cookie cursor black, as if it were being burn, which is comical. In addition, even with minimal animation, the project conveys personality. Although, I find the frame rate set to 10 detracts the aesthetic of the project because of its slowness. I think that if we were to increase the frame rate, the project would work more smoothly and fluid. Also, I believe that the bee's mouth should have been made the same width as the person dressed as a bee because of its feeling of asymmetry. Overall, I sense that this project sparks curiosity, as if the character is discovering the world around them for the first time.

This project caught my attention with its bold, surreal style and unsettling elements. What immediatly stood out to me was the element of the smoke animation coming out of the chimney and the wide, toothy grin, giving the work a quirky personality. The use of primary colors and simple shapes evokes a childlike collage, although the abnormal facial details makes it feel, without notice, expressive. The shifting sky colors, while constantly set in nighttime, creates a starry night atmosphere. In addition, the blend of red, orange and yellow tones adds a fiery warmth that contrats elegantly with the darkness of the sky. The addition of a floating cat's head as the mouse cursor adds to the surreal style, implementing a sense of imagination, almost dreamlike. Overall, this project creates a interesting blend of chaos and quiet.
